# LONG-TERM TODOS

* Documentation
* Write a documentation note about source structure
* note that it is a good practice to know which states are serial and which are parallel at the onset and use them as such
* note that when specifying animations, the animation must be declared for specific element and not pseudo-elements
* note that when using multiple classes for animation, these classes should not override the previous class's animation or transition property
* note that best practice is for root state is to be blank and be a template placeholder for other states
* root state must have a singular view (not a template).  Within a view an el property designates the element where app will be placed
* note when activating two serial states simultaneously, the last one will be canceled
* note that for class assignment on the view element itself will require using View instead of just a template
* note that all heavy async processing must happen before rendering
* note that because of strict mode some template converters will not work because of with and their templates should have a namespace variable
* note when writing animations, forwards option can be very helpful
* Sprinkle comments throughout code
* Tutorial
* start exploring how to write tests
