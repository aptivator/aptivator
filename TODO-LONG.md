# LONG-TERM TODOS

* allow to use a template property on the state instead of a view to tell framework to create a view
* deactivate() function, defined on a state, that controls how a state is deactivated
* when integrating actionify, apply it and reapply it to newly instantiated views (obviously)
* start exploring how to write tests
* start exploring how to rollup and bundle the frameweork for distribution
