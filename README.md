# Aptivator

Application activator is an architectural framework for [Backbone]- and 
[Marionette]-based single-page web programs (SPAs).  Design of the framework
embraces the inherent hierarchy in all software and provides an explicit 
mechanism to define and manage and thereby simplify code bureacracy.  The 
foundational premise driving Aptivator's development is decomposability of a 
program into sub-programs or sub-sub-programs, and so on, until no more 
destructuring is practical.  Viewing an application as consisting of standalone 
yet inter-related components is the essence of systemic thinking and a key 
practice in achieving a working modular code with manageable complexity and 
high reusability.

For example, 


Keeping related entities together

The need for systematization increases with increase in code volume and complexity.

Mention that Angular's UI-Router was a source of inspiration
